## Introduction
The zebra finch is a widely used model for studying vocal learning and neural mechanisms related to speech. This project provides an affordable solution to record iEEG signals from zebra finches using OpenBCI hardware. The recorded data helps investigate the effects of anesthesia and auditory stimuli on brain activity.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `mne`, `matplotlib`, etc.
